                    <p>Kingâ€™s Bluff is a rock-climbing area located in Clarksville, TN. It is managed by a local nonprofit organization called the SCC. This is a great climbing area that is free to visit and has a variety of routes that range in difficulty from 5.3 up to 5.12. The height of climbs also varies greatly, from 30 to 120 feet. There truly is a climb here for everyone. It is free to enter but you must enter a gate code to gain access to the parking lot. You can find the steps to do that by visiting <a href="https://www.seclimbers.org/">https://www.seclimbers.org/</a>.</p>
